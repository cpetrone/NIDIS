# Non-Isothermal Diffusion Incremental Step (NIDIS)

These MATLAB codes were developed to apply a Non-Isothermal Diffusion Incremental Step model to reconstruct crystal lifetime histories helping to constrain pre-eruptive magmatic processes. The model is explained in the paper freely accessible at http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12946 published on Nature Communications on the 5th October 2016


1) greyvalues.m is used to extract greyvalues from images.

2) createfit.m and createfitFS.m are used to fit the greyvalues and hence calculate the residence time of crystals. createfit.m is to be used with semi-infinite sources profiles, while createfitFS is to be used with finite sources.
